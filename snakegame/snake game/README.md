# Basic Snake HTML and JavaScript Game

Snake is a fun game to make as it doesn't require a lot of code (less than 100 lines with all comments removed). This is a basic implementation of the snake game, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.

## Further Exploration

- Score
  - When the snake eats an apple, the score should increase by one. Use [context.fillText()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillText) to display the score to the screen
- Mobile and touchscreen support
  - Allow the game to be scaled down to a phone size. See https://codepen.io/straker/pen/VazMaL
  - Support [touch controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events)
- Better apple spawning
  - Currently the apple spawns in any random grid in the game, even if the snake is already on that spot. Improve it so it only spawns in empty grid locations
  
**Important note:** I will answer questions about the code but will not add more features or answer questions about adding more features. This series is meant to give a basic outline of the game but nothing more.
