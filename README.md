# Encoder & Decoder Web Application

A simple and intuitive web tool to encode and decode text using various methods such as URL, Base64, HTML Entity, Unicode, Hexadecimal, and Binary.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean design that allows users to quickly input text and get the encoded or decoded output.
- **Multiple Encoding & Decoding Methods**:
  - URL Encoding & Decoding
  - Base64 Encoding & Decoding
  - HTML Entity Encoding & Decoding
  - Unicode Escape & Unescape
  - Hexadecimal Encoding & Decoding
  - Binary Encoding & Decoding

## Usage

1. Navigate to the web application.
2. Enter your text in the input textarea.
3. Select the desired operation (e.g., "URL Encode", "Base64 Decode", etc.).
4. The result will be displayed in the output textarea below.

## Important Notes

- **URL Encoding & HTML Entity Encoding**: These methods primarily target special characters. This means that standard alphanumeric characters are often not encoded using these methods. If you notice certain characters remain unchanged after encoding, this behavior is expected.
