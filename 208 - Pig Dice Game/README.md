## Game Rules

The rules of the Pig Game are easy to understand:

- Two players take turns rolling a standard six-sided die.
- On a player's turn, they can roll the die as often as they like and accumulate points with each roll.
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points accumulated during that turn, and their turn ends.
- The player can choose to "Hold" and add their turn points to their total score to secure them.
- The first player to reach the target score (default is 100 points) wins the game.
