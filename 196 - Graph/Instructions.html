    <li>Graph Plotter is an online application designed to plot basic graphs and curves of basic equations in<br>
        two dimensions. So always be wary to use variables in two dimensions only. This application is not<br>
        capable of graph in three dimensions since HTML5's canvas hasn't introduced 3d drawing yet.
    </li><br>
    <li>You can use basic functions and any two variables,but make sure that you use one variable as 'x' and<br>
        other variable as 'y'. Any other variables used may not be noticed and you can get an error. So make<br>
        sure that you input equations correctly.
    </li><br> 
    <li>
      Beyond simple math and grouping(like " (x+2)(x-4) "), there are some functions you can use as well.<br>
      Look below to see them all . They are the most standard functions written as you might expect. You <br>
      can also use pi as 3.14 or "e" as their respective constants.<br>
    </li><br>
    <li>
      Graph Plotter uses a fixed scale of 640x480 pixels and for complex functions like sin,log it uses a<br>
      scale of 30x30 pixels(for more precision).So don not try to put functions that have't got graphs in<br>
      this range.

  <li>You should not use fractional exponents or fractional coefficients. For example do not type :<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<del>x^(1/3)</del> or <del>(1/8)*y + (2/8)x</del>
