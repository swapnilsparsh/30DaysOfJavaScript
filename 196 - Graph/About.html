      Graph Plotter is an online web-application that plots the graph of the functions in two dimensions.<br>
      It assumes variables to be x and y and plots the graph of the corresponding equation . It uses some<br>
      basic HTML5, pHp but javascript is the main backbone of this application.
    </li><br>
    <li>
      This application is able to plot the graph of:
      <ul type="square">
        <li>Linear algebric functions
        <li>Quadratic algebric functions
        <li>Cubic algebric functions
        <li>Trignometric functions
        <li>Exponential functions
        <li>Logarithmic functions
        <li>Ellipses, Hyperbolas
        <li>Circles, Paraboas
        <li>Most real-valued functions in two variables
      </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li>
    This application uses string parsing for most of its processing . A linked list data structure is used to<br>
    store polynomial and that polynomial is used by the javascript functions to draw the graph on HTML<br>
    canvas . This project was built to help students pursuing calculus understand the behaviour of many<br>
    functions by slight change in their arguments, coefficients etc.
    </li><br>
    <li>
    You can use graph plotter for your personal home and school assignments and for your own curiosity.<br>
    Graph Plotter is not designed for commercial use. It can only plot simple graphs and it is can not<br>
    plot complex graphs of complex functions.It is only designed to plot functions that have with real<br>
    valued solutions. Don't try to put equations with complex roots.
