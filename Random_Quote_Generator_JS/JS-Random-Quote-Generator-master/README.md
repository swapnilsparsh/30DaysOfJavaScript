### Treehouse Techdegree Project #1 - Random Quote Generator

In this project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You can display a quote from a famous athlete, politician, or historical figure:

"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." â€” Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

You'll need to use your knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, including variables, loops and object literals, to complete this project.

This project is a fun and effective way for you to practice fundamental JavaScript skills. It also gives you a simple interactive portfolio piece to show off your understanding of JavaScript.

# Appraiser Comments
Awesome work, Richard! Your project looks great and after seeing so many of these, I appreciate you changing the styling up.

Nice job ensuring that your function returns the entire quote object and then adding in those extra features! I added a hint in the individual rubric if you want to try creating a non-repeating randomizer.

You're ready to move on to the next project and get further into JavaScript. Have fun!

Thanks for being a Techdegree student.
